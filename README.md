> GKI kernel source code used here is compatible for all the Xiaomi SM8550 devices, but this repo was created only for testing on devices that I have, the kernel built may not suitable for using on other devices or ROMs other than HyperOS .

Currently it uses the code from:<br>
[SukiSU GKI Action Repo](https://github.com/ShirkNeko/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS)<br>
[hfdem's Kernel](https://github.com/hfdem/android_gki_kernel_5.15_common)
